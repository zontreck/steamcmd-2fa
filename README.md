# steamcmd-2fa

A simple tool that automatically generates a 2FA Steam Guard code and then runs `steamcmd` with that login and the rest of your arguments.

## Installation

You can either clone this and build it yourself or use the supplied binaries for both Windows and Linux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zontreck/steamcmd-2fa
cd steamcmd-2fa
cargo build
```

## Usage
```
USAGE:
    steamcmd-2fa --path <PATH> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD> --secret <SECRET> --args <ARGS>

OPTIONS:
    -a, --args <ARGS>               Arguments to pass to steamcmd
    -h, --help                      Print help information
    -p, --password <PASSWORD>       Password to log in with
        --path <PATH>               Path to steamcmd binary
    -s, --secret <SECRET>           2FA shared_secret (must be base64 encoded)
    -u, --username <USERNAME>       Username to log in with
```

For example, instead of running `steamcmd +login exampleuser examplepass +quit`, you would run `steamcmd-2fa --path /home/steam/steamcmd --username exampleuser --password examplepass --secret YOURSECRET --args "+quit"`. 

You can get your 2FA seed by [various methods](https://github.com/SteamTimeIdler/stidler/wiki/Getting-your-%27shared_secret%27-code-for-use-with-Auto-Restarter-on-Mobile-Authentication). Your seed here is the `shared_secret`.

**Please keep your seed/secret VERY safe as people with your seed can easily bypass your 2FA by simply generating the Steam Guard codes themselves!**
